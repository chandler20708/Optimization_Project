# 🌍 International Coal Case Study – Optimization Web App

This project is an **interactive optimization web application** built as part of the *Mathematical Programming and Optimization* coursework at Alliance Manchester Business School.  
It models and visualizes an **energy generation planning problem** for an international coal company, combining **profit maximization** with **environmental constraints** such as SO₂ and CO₂ emissions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The optimization model determines the **optimal fuel mix** (coal, biomass, stockpile, etc.) across multiple months and demand bands to:

- Maximize total profit (revenue – fuel cost – carbon cost – investment)
- Respect generation capacity, SO₂ bubble limit, and biomass share constraints
- Evaluate trade-offs under different **price and policy scenarios**

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Gurobi-based LP/MILP model**  
  Includes decision variables for fuel mix, emission levels, and FGD investment.
- **Scenario and sensitivity analysis**  
  Test how changes in electricity price, fuel cost, or emission price affect profit and fuel decisions.
- **Streamlit web app interface**  
  Allows users to adjust parameters, run optimization, and visualize results interactively.
- **Dynamic visualizations**  
  - Fuel mix bar chart (by month/band)  
  - Profit comparison across scenarios  
  - Constraint binding heatmaps  
  - Biomass share and emission composition plots
- **Experiment logging**  
  Stores model inputs and outputs in session state for later analysis.

## 🧮 Model Highlights

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Decision Variables** | `x[fuel, month, band]`: tons burned per fuel/month/band; binary FGD investment variable |
| **Objective** | See mathematical form below |
| **Constraints** | Energy balance, capacity, biomass ≤ 10%, SO₂ bubble, FGD efficiency, and emission limits |

**Objective function:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
\max Z
&= \sum_{m \in \text{Months}} \sum_{b \in \text{Bands}} 
\Bigg[
(\text{price}_{m,b} - 0.65)\,\text{energy}_{m,b}
+ \text{ROC}\,\text{energy}_{\text{Biomass}, m, b} \\
&\quad - \sum_{f \in \text{Fuels}}\text{fuel\_cost}_f\,x_{f,m,b}
- \text{CO2\_price}\,\text{exchange\_rate}\,0.8\,\text{energy}_{m,b} \\
&\quad - \text{SO2\_reduced}_{m,b}\,\text{SO2\_price}
\Bigg]
- \text{FGD\_cost}
\end{aligned}
